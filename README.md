Examcheck is a utility to check available times for a driving exam, in Sweden.
It currently only checks motorcycle exam times. In order to use it, you need to 
have a file, "personnummer.txt", containing personnummer, one per line.

When a person completes their exam, the personnummer must be removed from the list,
as it cannot be used for searches any more.

Regarding locations: they are defined numerically. By default, it searches
on Västra Haninge, Västra Haninge 2 and Gillinge. If you want to change this,
you need to dig up the codes for the places you want to search for.

Regarding notifications: install the app ntfy.sh and subscribe to the 'topic' that
you tell this program to use. That's it.

This program is supplied in the hope that it will be useful, that it will
_decrease_ the load on trafikverket's pages and provide people with equal chances
of obtaining a slot.

This program comes with no guarantees, use at your own discretion.
